                <h3>Digital Media in Healthcare:</h3> <p>Digital media in healthcare enhances patience experiences and lower costs. Todayâ€™s hospitals need innovative approaches to deliver an excellent care experience without increasing human resource costs. <br>Today most hospitals use TVs on mobile carts to show videos on pre-operative education, discharge instructions, and treatment education. TV cart with information helps patients while they are waiting. Nurses spend more time on documenting and makes sure that the patients have received discharge instructions. Maintaining a library of DVDs on different topics and in different languages is a growing a part of the staff workload. A better solution could reduce labour costs and increase the efficiency of patient care.Digital Media System is a comprehensive suite of applications for digital signage, desktop video, and interactive TV over the IP network. </p>

                 <p> You can use it to centrally manage the delivery of education and training to patients and clinicians. Benefits may include more efficient resource allocation, higher patient satisfaction, and greater convenience for clinicians and staff.<br>Ready access to information about procedures helps to increase patient satisfaction. TV in their rooms or a waiting room, in a variety of languages. This can save the costs of personal translators or dedicated instructors. Patients can watch at home, using desktop video, to prepare questions for their physicians. The option to watch multiple times benefits patients who are nervous or physically uncomfortable during the first viewing. And the Digital Media System logs all sessions, automatically documenting when patients receive discharge instructions.</p>
